    To my dear brother,

    Today is a special day to remind you of how special you are to me and our family. As you get older, I want to remind you that challenges, mistakes, and opportunities are part of life.
    
   Challenges teach you that life is not a bed of roses; it's about learning to dance in the rain with the hashtag #nevergiveup. Only a fool gives up A.K.A. "Na mumu dey give up"
    
  Don't dwell on your mistakes; everyone makes them. Learn from them and move forward.
    
    For opportunities, seize every good one life presents and create memories. Remember, time is a valuable asset. Don't waste it on missed opportunities.
    
    In all, tighten your seatbelt and enjoy the journey. May the spirit of our ancestors, our dear father, and the Almighty God keep, protect, and guide your path.
    
    Happy birthday to you! May this new age bring amazing opportunities and beautiful memories. Lots of love
  </p>
